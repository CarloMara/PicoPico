# Pico Pico

Project to attempt to create hardware for the [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

![Hello world](artifacts/hello_world.gif?raw=1)

I'd like to eventually get a very basic game running on a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html)

Be aware, the code will be terrible, this is a project to learn:

* C
* SDL
* Embedded
